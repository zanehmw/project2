# Feedback

See [rubric](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/project2/blob/master/evaluation.md)

## Technical Requirements

*Performing* - Your app has plenty of technical complexity between the models
and their associations, and custom behavior such as ratings / avg ratings. Main
suggestion for this area would be to take advantage of the user auth to
associate reviews and ratings with users to prevent duplicate ratings / people
from editing each other's reviews.

## Creativity and Interface

*Progressing* - This isn't the most important aspect of Project 2, but I'd
definitely like to see a little more thought put into some of the most high-impact
parts of the UI (such as the header... on my computer it's broken on a new line
which is confusing).

## Code Quality

*Performing* - Please see my inline comments for more detail, but overall
your code is pretty good. Main suggestion would be to be a bit more careful /
thoughtful when copy/pasting code, and choosing better / more descriptive
variable names.

## Deployment and Functionality

*Excelling* - Your app has a solid amount of functionality for this point in
the course, good job!

## Planning / Process / Submission

*Incomplete* - I can't find any evidence of user stories, wireframes, ERDs, or
readme in this project folder. If you resubmit them I'm happy to give feedback
on them.

These items are all critical in developing / maintaining an app as it grows,
and a good readme is helpful when showing your project to potential employers.
